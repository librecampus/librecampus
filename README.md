# Librecampus

A modern, flexible, usable opensource virtual campus web app for higher education institutions 
powered by React, Django, PostgreSQL and Redis.

## Motivation

We want to give students of both public and private higher education institutions the benefits of
using a modern, flexible, usable virtual campus web application supporting among other features:

* Academic records including grades from past and current courses.
* Enrollment information, class schedules, course progress status, assigment and grading information.
* Course material distribution and collection including assignment uploads within scheduled time frames.
* Periodic polling on professor performance and academic services quality.

## Main technologies

* [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and friends (modern frontend development libraries)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) (productive backend framework powered by Python)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (advance opensource relational database)
* [Redis](https://redis.io) (handy swiss-knife networked data structures server used for speeding things up and coordinating work among components)

## Status

**IMPORTANT:** 

* The work on Librecampus has just barely started.
* As of September 2019 we're heavily focused on producing a product backlog for the project.
* We will be developing the project privately on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/librecampus) and will be syncing code with this repo.
